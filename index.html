    <p>
      <strong>Welcome.</strong> We’re glad you found us! No, we don’t look like our former clinic that provided
      speech, language, and communication supports for 22 years. But we have learned a lot over
      the years — and post-pandemic, we are dedicated to sharing thoughts that will continue to
      support natural speech, language, and communication development!

    <p>
      <strong>Yes, there is a backstory here... one that needs to be told.</strong> Our ancient website had a
      crack in it, one we couldn’t fix. The website was so old that we couldn’t change, or even
      delete, anything! Marge Blanc’s published articles and book used language that was
      commonly used in 2004, and even in 2013, when the most recent writing was published.
      But that language now risks communicating ableism and disrespect. And it can hurt the
      feelings of some of the very people the writing was meant to embrace. Current terminology
      referring to autistics was not used then, so you read language like 'children with autism,'
      and 'children on the autism spectrum.’ Please know that I wrote those words without the
      understanding I have today. And please know that regardless of my ancient terminology, I
      honor (and honored) you and the people I wrote about back in the day! I can't fix those
      published articles and book, but I can address the issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Autistic people let us know that the crack in our bell interfered with our message. Autistic
      people let us know that we could not expect our message of honor and respect to get
      through that flaw. But their light/your light shined through that very same crack — and our
      website is being up-dated as you read this. If I can’t change the articles, I can at least
      explain what happened, and provide a disclaimer with each of the writings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please accept my apology. It is deeply felt and sincere. And stay tuned. Your light will be reflected back to you!
